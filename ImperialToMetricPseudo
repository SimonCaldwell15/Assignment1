This program converts a weight given in imperial units (tons, stones, pounds, ounces)
to the metric equivalent in metric tons, kilograms, and grams.

input =
tons = "Enter number of tons" (imperial)
stones = "Enter number of stones" 
pounds = "Enter number of pounds"
ounces = "Enter number of ounces"

calculate = 
totalOunces = 35840 * tons + 224 * stones + 16 * pounds + ounces;
totalKilos = totalOunces / 35.274;
metricTons = totalKilos /1000
remainingKilos = totalKilos - metric tons * 1000
kilos =  remainingkilos 
grams = remainingKilos - kilos * 1000
